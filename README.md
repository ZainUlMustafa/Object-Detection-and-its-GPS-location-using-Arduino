# Object-Detection-and-its-GPS-location-using-Arduino
Color based object detection in Python3 and its GPS location using Arduino GPS shield.

Prerequisites:
1) Install Python3
2) Install OpenCV
3) Install pyserial
4) Install Arduino IDE
5) Install Adafruit GPS Library
6) Upload the opencvGPS.ino to Arduino (note the baudrate for Serial Read/Write
7) Note the serial port (eg: Windows will have something like COM3, Raspberry Pi3 have something like /dev/ttyACM1, Google for MAC and Linux)
8) Run the python code

If you are on Linux, MAC, or using RaspberryPi: simply clone this repo by:
